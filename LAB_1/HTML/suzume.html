            Suzume, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a quiet town in Kyushu,
            encounters a traveling young man who tells her "I'm looking for a
            door." She follows after him and discovers a weathered door in the
            ruins in the mountains, as if it were the only thing left standing
            from a collapse. As if drawn by something, Suzume reaches for the
            door...
          </p>
          <p>
            Before long, doors begin to open one after another in various parts
            of Japan. As disasters come from the far side of the doors, the open
            doors must be closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stars, the setting sun, and the morning sky—in that place she
            wandered into, there was a sky that seemingly blended all of time
            together. Guided by the mysterious doors, Suzume's "door-locking
            journey" begins.
